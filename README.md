# PostgreSQL for Swift

A Swift wrapper for PostgreSQL.

- [x] Thread-Safe
- [x] Prepared Statements
- [x] Tested

This wrapper uses the latest PostgreSQL fetch API to enable performant prepared statements and output bindings. 

The Swift wrappers around the PostgreSQL's C structs and pointers automatically manage closing connections and deallocating memeory. Additionally, the PostgreSQL library API is used to perform thread safe, performant queries to the database.


## Examples

### Connecting to the Database

```swift
import PostgreSQL

let postgreSQL =  PostgreSQL.Database(
    dbname: "test",
    user: "root",
    password: ""
)
```

### Select

```swift
let version = try postgreSQL.execute("SELECT version()")
```

### Prepared Statement

The second parameter to `execute()` is an array of `PostgreSQL.Value`s.

```swift
let results = try postgreSQL.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= $1", [.int(21)])
```

```swift
public enum Value {
    case string(String)
    case int(Int)
    case bool(Int)
    case double(Double)
    case null
}
```

### Connection

Each call to `execute()` creates a new connection to the PostgreSQL database. This ensures thread safety since a single connection cannot be used on more than one thread.

If you would like to re-use a connection between calls to execute, create a reusable connection and pass it as the third parameter to `execute()`.

```swift
let connection = try postgreSQL.makeConnection()
let result = try postgreSQL.execute("SELECT LAST_INSERTED_ID() as id", [], connection)
```

No need to worry about closing the connection.

## Building

### macOS

Install PostgreSQL

```shell
brew install postgresql
brew link postgresql
brew services start postgresql

// to stop 
brew services stop postgresql
```

### Linux

Install PostgreSQL

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
psql -h dbhost -U username dbname
```

`swift build` should work normally.

## Fluent

This wrapper was created to power [Fluent](https://github.com/qutheory/fluent), an ORM for Swift.
